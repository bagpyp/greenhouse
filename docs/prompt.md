**Hypothetical Engineering Problem: Temperature Control in a Greenhouse**
You are tasked with developing a temperature control system for a small greenhouse. The goal is to maintain a stable
temperature range within the greenhouse to ensure optimal plant growth. The system should adjust heating and cooling
mechanisms based on real-time temperature readings and external weather conditions.

**Components of the Greenhouse System:**

1. **Temperature Sensors:** These sensors provide real-time temperature data from different locations within the
   greenhouse.
2. **Heating System:** The heating system is used to increase the temperature within the greenhouse. It might consist of
   heaters or heating mats.
3. **Cooling System:** The cooling system helps reduce the temperature when it gets too high. This could involve fans,
   vents, or misting systems.
4. **Weather Data:** External weather data, including temperature forecasts, is available to anticipate changes in the
   ambient temperature.

**Key Challenges:**

1. **Temperature Fluctuations:** The temperature inside the greenhouse can fluctuate due to changes in external weather
   conditions and solar radiation.
2. **Quick Response:** The control system needs to respond quickly to temperature changes to prevent drastic temperature
   swings that can harm plants.
3. **Energy Efficiency:** The goal is to maintain the desired temperature range while minimizing energy consumption and
   associated costs.

**Proposed Solution:**
You need to develop a Python-based temperature control algorithm that uses real-time temperature sensor data and
external weather forecasts to manage the heating and cooling systems within the greenhouse. The algorithm will involve
the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Collect real-time temperature data from sensors placed at different locations within the
   greenhouse. Also, gather external weather data and forecasts.
2. **Mathematical Modeling:** Create a mathematical model that takes into account the current temperature, desired
   temperature range, and forecasted weather conditions to determine whether heating or cooling is required.
3. **Algorithm Design:** Design an algorithm that calculates the necessary adjustments to the heating and cooling
   systems based on the temperature data and weather forecasts. Consider factors such as rate of temperature change and
   hysteresis to prevent excessive system switching.
4. **Control Logic:** Develop the control logic that decides when to activate the heating or cooling systems based on
   the algorithm's calculations.
5. **Implementation:** Implement the control algorithm using Python, possibly utilizing libraries like NumPy for
   calculations and external APIs for weather data retrieval.
6. **Integration:** Interface the control algorithm with the actual heating and cooling systems in the greenhouse. This
   might involve controlling actuators like heaters and fans.
7. **Testing and Validation:** Test the system using simulated temperature data and real weather forecasts. Validate its
   performance by observing how well it maintains the desired temperature range.
8. **Fine-tuning:** Iterate on the algorithm and control logic as needed to ensure smooth and efficient temperature
   control.
   By successfully implementing this system, you can demonstrate effective control of temperature fluctuations in the
   greenhouse, supporting healthy plant growth and showcasing your engineering and programming skills in a smaller-scale
   project.
